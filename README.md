Movie database search engine App.

Built using react.js

Setup :

    1. Clone the repository
    // In terminal from root directory folder
    2. npm install
    3. npm start

Extras : With more time and if this were in a real working environment, I would have...

    1. Made the app responsive, mobile first.
    2. Fully tested accessibility.
    3. Stop multiple requests.
    4. Unit testing.
